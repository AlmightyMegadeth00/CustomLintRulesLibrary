Set of additional lint rules to strengthen code quality and compile time safety.  I will add more to the collection as the need to write them arises.  They can be enabled by consuming this library as a local jar file or from jitpack.io
</br></br>
Rules:
</br>1) Magic Number Detector
</br>2) Magic String Detector
</br>3) Json Parsing: check for well-formed syntax in all json assets included with the build
</br>4) Json Parsing: check and fail if trailing commas are found in any Json assets

Coming soon:
</br> Json asset schema validation
